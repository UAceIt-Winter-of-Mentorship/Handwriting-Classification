### About the project
Handwriting recognition is a computer’s ability to recognize and interpret handwritten input. It’s sometimes known as handwritten text recognition.
The focus of this project is to further survey the task of classifying handwritten text and to convert handwritten text into digital format. In this project, we took on the challenge of classifying the image of any handwritten word, which might be in the form of cursive or block writing.

### Conclusion
- The objective of this project is to recognize the real time handwritten text from a scanned image. After several experiments we conclude a set of hyper parameters for a better neural network with highest accuracy.

***

### Future Scope
- In future the ability of the Neural Networks will be improved to extract more number of features, improve Neural Networks ability to recognize the real time handwritten text irrespective of its orientation.
